Here are a few behaviors that both CDs and DVDs share:

    They both spin.
    They both store data - Instance field (for capacity and list of data)
    Data gets written to the discs by using a laser.
    The data on the discs can be read by using a laser - Instance Field (Reads from list)
    Once loaded, they both report information like name, capacity, contents, and disc type.

    ^^All abstract class (base disc)

    Plays Media (IMediaPlayable)
    Spins Discs (IOpticalDisc)
